# ¡Hola! 👋🏽

Welcome to my blog!

As I've been growing up, I found that I have been rediscovering some ideas multiple times. I haven't been very keen on documenting the evolution of my thoughts throughout my life. I kinda regret that a little bit now since all I have about my previous thoughts and beliefs is my memory of them, and memory can be very tricky.

So I decided some time ago that I needed to start blogging. I have been exploring different options and then decided that using GitHub pages is probably the most convenient method right now.

Since I have recently discovered my love for philosophy, some of my posts can be a bit philosophical in nature.

Another reason why I find blogging can be useful is that it can help me think more clearly about the stuff I'm writing about, and see how people agree or disagree with them, and maybe engage in some interesting conversations.
